# SuperNaiveCppLib

This is a Cpp library full of super naive wheels and **collected** wheels (see ref).

Because it's so naive, no comments and documentation supported. And its code-style is much messy.

No common namespace, because it's loosely connected

## Wheel List (super naive, all incomplete)
* sn_Alg: some algorithms
* sn_AOP: a simple AOP frame
* sn_Assist: some general assist template/functions
* sn_DB: a wrapper of MySQL C API
* sn_DBP: a MySQL connection pool
* sn_Decimal: a big integer library
* sn_DS: some data structures
* sn_Log: a log class
* sn_Macro: some macros
* sn_Reflection: two realizations of reflection (magic_get/pod_reflect && register_reflect/typeless)
* sn_String: a class dealing with string
